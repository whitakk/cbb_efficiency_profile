# cbb_efficiency_profile

I wondered if some offenses are affected more/less than others by facing better/worse opponents. Think a team that takes and makes a lot of tough shots like UCLA -- can't they get the shots they want against pretty much any defense? 

A way to measure this is "opponent elasticity" -- over the course of the season, how much did a team's offensive efficiency increase when facing worse defenses? 

This repo contains this analysis, which is mostly a null finding -- although there are some non-random differences in "opponent elasticities", they're so small that they have basically no practical value, and they don't strongly correlate with any measures of offensive style.
